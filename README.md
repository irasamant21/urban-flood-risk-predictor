# urban-flood-risk-predictor
This project builds a classification model using the Urban Flood Risk Data: Global City Analysis 2025 dataset from Kaggle to predict city flood risk (high, medium, low). By analyzing rainfall, elevation, infrastructure, and population density, it highlights key drivers of risk and supports informed urban planning decisions.
